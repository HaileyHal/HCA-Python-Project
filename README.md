# HCA-Python-Project

Welcome to my HCA Python Project! This was completed as an honors mentoring agreement with Dr. Brinley Zabriskie. I was tasked with answering this question: "During times of natural disasters, how can patient assistance be improved through better organizing available resources from within a larger healthcare company and available emergency preparedness and disaster relief resources?"

This prompt comes from the HCA Healthcare Challenge from the AIS Student Chapters. The link to the competition page can be found here:

My solution was to research how many employees are typcially needed in the event of a disaster, how many are available, and how travel/transfer costs. The goal is that a manager at an affected hospital will be able to input their hospital facility and the level of an incoming hurricane, and be able to know how many employees they need and where they will come from (optimized with the cheapest flight prices).

Within this repo you will find:
- the HCA employee file (with coordinates added)
- all the pieces of my main code (mapping, json conversion, and analytics)
- the final product (FINALPROJECT.py)
- all of the other random files I used to clean and put things together
